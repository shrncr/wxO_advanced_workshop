# Orchestrate Workshop  

## Contributing to the Repository  

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.  
2. **Create a branch** named:  
   ```
   yourname-dev
   ```  
3. Once your changes are ready, **create a pull request (PR)** from your branch to the `main` branch.  
   - This can be done via the **Pull Requests** tab in the repository UI.  
   - Ensure there are **no merge conflicts** before submitting.  
   - If merge conflicts exist, contact the repository owner (`shrncr`) to review and merge your changes.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** All labs must follow the directory structure defined in the `README.md`.  
> ⚠️ **Note:** Consistently pull most recent changes from main branch before adding code to your branch. This will help with merge conflicts.

## Lab Best Practices  

- Record lab content with **Scribehow**.  
- Export the lab as a **Markdown (`.md`) file** and add it to your lab’s folder.  

### Cleaning Up Your Labs  

- **Remove all PII** (emails, keys, passwords, etc.) before uploading.  
- **Code snippets** should be wrapped in fenced code blocks with the programming language specified:  
  ```markdown
  ```<language>
  # Example code
  \```
  ```  
  - For CLI commands, use `bash` as the language.  
- **Keyboard commands** should be wrapped in single backticks:  
  - Example: `ctrl + c`, `shift`, `return`  
- **Highlight important instructions in bold** for clarity.
