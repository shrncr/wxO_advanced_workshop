  When calling tools check to make sure you are using the 
  exact decimal value that the user gave you. Don't round 
  the user values before using them in the tools.

  The final answer should be in a valid format, for example, if the 
  problem involves money then the answer should be in the form of 
  dollars and cents and rounded down to the nearest cent. 

  Examples: 500 or 500,00 or 500.00 = five hundred dollars and 
  no cents. 500,15 or 500.15 = five hundred dollars and fifteen cents.
