# Step 3: Load the agents

## Setup
ðŸš¨ Do this step AFTER you have added the connections

ðŸš¨ Do this AFTER you have added the models

---

ðŸš€ Now, let's use the yaml import method to get the agents loaded. This is way faster than creating agents via the UI and allows for more control of the agent's attributes. 

ðŸ§¨ The order that we load these agents is important because agents with collaborator agents defined will not load until the collaborator agents are available. For example, the `llm_as_judge.yaml` agent wants two collaborator agents which are defined in the `gemini_2_agent.yaml` and the `openai_agent.yaml` files so it has to be the last one we import. ðŸ¤“

```bash
orchestrate agents import --file src/agents/gemini_2_agent.yaml

orchestrate agents import --file src/agents/openai_agent.yaml

orchestrate agents import --file src/agents/llm_as_judge.yaml
```

Congratulations you have completed Step 3 of the lab.
